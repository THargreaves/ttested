    "If you want to become skilled in solving mathematical puzzles, it is important to develop a large arsenal of techniques that can be thrown at any new problem you come across. One such technique that I has repeatedly been of use to me—especially in the context of optimisation—is the reflection principle. Such problems have appeared in competitive maths problems, quantitative finance interviews, and even some everyday problems. I was unable to find a comprehensive resource on this problem solving strategy, so I wanted to document a few examples in this blog post."

    "It is worth mentioning, that although the reflection principle has important use cases, it does not appear in the wild as frequently as more standard methods such as dynamic programming and case analysis. For that reason, although it is beneficial to be aware of the technique, don't expect that it can be applied to all (or every many) problems you come across. Instead, this technique fascinates me due to the breadth of fields and scenarios it can be used in, as will hopefully be demonstrated by the following examples."

But here's the kicker: every path from A' to B must pass through the river (as they're on different sides of it). We've therefore reduced our problem to finding the shortest path between two points subject to no extra conditions—i.e. a straight line. We can then reflect the part of the path below the river to retrieve the solution to our original problem."

That is, we start at time $t = 0$ with a share price of £$x$ and at each time step this increases by £1 with probability $p$ and decreases by the same amount with probability $1-p$. An example of such a random walk is shown below. For simplicity, we allow the share price to go into negatives."

This problem isn't too difficult to answer using the binomial distribution. We can think of the price movement up to time $t = 100$ as a series of coin flips using a biased coin (probability $p$ of getting heads). Our final share price will be the initial price plus the number of heads and minus the number of tails. \n",

Passing through zero sounds an awful lot like crossing the river in the previous problem—it seems like the reflection principle will be of use again."

    "The final puzzle I want to discuss is, in fact, the inspiration for writing this blog post. It is an example of a rather fiendish-looking puzzle that reveals a beautifully simplistic cure if approached with the right technique. It involves firing a laser beam into the reflective interior of an equilateral triangle, with infintesimal gaps at the vertices. For any integer $n$ we want to know how many directions we can fire the laser such that the beam will leave through the same hole it entered after exactly $n$ bounces."

    "Looking back on the previous two examples, let's try to summarise exactly what the reflection principle involves so we can see how it would apply to this problem. Specifically, in both cases we started with a problem in which we required our path to be reflected. This proved conceptually difficult and so we tried a different approach—reflecting the world around our path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, our reflected line became a straight line starting from a reflected village. Likewise, in the second, our reflected path became an unrestricted path starting from a reflection of the initial share price. A similar idea can be used for this problem: rather than reflecting the laser beam's path, we pretend it has a perfectly straight path and instead reflect the world around it. That is, whenever the laser hits a mirror, we let it continue on its original path and create a reflected copy of the triangle on the other side of the mirror. This is illustrated the following diagram."

    "First, we no longer have to worry about the defining a laser beam by the angle it enters the triangle at. Instead, we can create a coordinate system for the expanded triangular grid relate each angle to the coordinate of the vertex it is pointed at. We can extend this even further by noting that if we point at vertex $(4, 6)$, we will hit vertex $(2, 3)$. In other words, it is only possible to reach a vertex whose coordinates are coprime. It is also easy to tell what vertex the beam will leave the triangle at given this coordinate since the vertex colours have a consistent pattern."

The details and implementation of this I will have to be deliberately sparse on since it relates to a [Project Euler question](https://projecteuler.net/problem=202) that I do not wish to spoil. Never-the-less, I hope this much drives home how useful the reflection principle can be."
