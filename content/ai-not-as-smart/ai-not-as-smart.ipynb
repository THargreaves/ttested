The flip side of this is that, in trying to explain the intricacies of the data they have seen before, they can become incapable of handling any new inputs that deviate from what they're used to.

This is commonly caused by overfitting, in which a neural network gives too much weight to certain inputs and so becomes highly susceptible to changes in their values. This is most severe when the input data contains a feature that is not present in typical real-world testing data. In this case, the neural network can have an easy time training, outputting high confidence in its own abilities, even though its predictions are largely based on features of the training data that do not generalise.

    "[Another story](http://intelligence.org/files/AIPosNegFactor.pdf) from AI folklore tells of a US Army research venture in which a team of AI experts attempted to build a neural network that could detect camouflaged tanks given a candidate image. After working through the standard machine learning techniques of the era, the researchers ended up with a model that was remarkably accurate. The team then allegedly handed their final product into the Pentagon for review, which promptly handed it back, complaining that their own tests found the neural network to perform no better than a coin-toss. The story goes that the researcher's dataset had an inherent bias—the photos of camouflaged tanks had been taken on cloudy days, whilst the photos of tank-less forests had been taken on sunny days. Since the overall colour-temperature of the image correlated so well with the presence of a tank, the model never bothered to actually learn how to detect a tank but rather how to read the weather!"

    "I hope that this post has convinced you that the current state of AI is perhaps not as powerful as a bystander would be led to believe. Yes, great work with great outcomes is being undertaken, but often when you pull back the curtain, you can find AI systems that are still immature and struggle to adapt. The challenges discussed in this post are only the tip of the iceberg for what AI must overcome in the following decades before near human-level intelligence could be reached and any threat could begin to manifest itself."

    "However, this long road to success has proved not to be an obstacle for certain parties interested in AI applications. Robot Wars Judge and Professor of AI and Robotics [Noel Sharkley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Sharkey) has [been talking](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/18/comment.military) since the mid-noughties about the steady adoption of AI system in military contexts. Systems similar to those mentioned above that are so easily fooled or can behave so erratically are being implemented _right now_ and yet relatively little uproar is being made in response."

    "The first step in making a difference is learning the lay of the land. To do this, I would recommend reading the [other post](https://musingmirai.wordpress.com/2020/10/02/the-debate-on-lethal-autonomous-weapons//) in this series in which my colleague [Orlanda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orlandagill/) explores the current use of AI in military settings and the risks this presents. I hope that these two posts combined will aid your considerations regarding the importance of both current and future risks of AI."
