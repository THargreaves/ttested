    "excerpt: \"Deciding the winner of a round-robin tournament is no simple task. The most na√Øve approach can easily be faltered by the existence of $k$-paradoxical tournaments. But what are these tournaments and what do we know about them? There is surprisingly little discussion on the topic and so, in this post, I plan to collate various pieces of knowledge on the subject into one succinct guide.\"\n",

    "Suppose that you are organising a tournament in which $n$ each take turns to play one another exactly once. This is known as a round robin tournament. We can represent this visually using a complete oriented graph on $n$ vertices where a directed edge from vertex $v$ to $w$ means that player $v$ won the game against $w$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should probably roughly define the terms that we just used. A complete graph on $n$ vertices is one where there is an edge between every distinct pair of vertices. Further, an oriented graph is a directed graph in which only one of the directed edges $(x,y)$ or $(y,x)$ appear in the edge set. Hence a complete oriented graph is a graph in which every distinct vertex pair has exactly one directed edge between them.\n",

The problem is, that this dominating player cannot always be found. In fact, it is not difficult at all to construct a counter-example. The smallest $n$ we need to do this is 3, as shown here."
