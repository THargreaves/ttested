    "Recently, I have become more and more interested in the sort of coding problems that are typically used in job interviews for developer and software engineering roles. In particular, whilst browsing [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/), I came across an interview question previously used by Google called 'The Knight's Dialler'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem goes as follows: You place a knight chess piece on one of the 10 digits of a standard mobile phone keypad (shown below). You then move it arbitrarily in the typical 'L'-shaped patterns to any other number on the keypad. For example, if you were on the 1 key, you would be able to move to either the 6 or 8 key. All keys except the 5 leave you with a possible new key to jump to. Suppose that as you make the knight hop around, every new key it lands on is dialled (i.e. we do not dial the key it starts on), generating a sequence of integers. The question is: given a specific starting point on the keypad and a fixed number of moves, how many possible distinct numbers can be dialled? "

    "### A Typical Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "After looking at many of the submitted solutions to this problem on Glassdoor and various coding-puzzle forums, I noticed that a common approach to this involved some sort of recursion. The fact that most people jump to this method makes complete sense; the problem has a very recursive nature to it. If, for a given starting point, you know the number of possible sequences that you can dial in $n-1$ steps, then all you have to do is enumerate these with the possible choices for the $n$th step and you have your solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with this sort of method is that recursion can often lead to exponential-time algorithms. That is, algorithms whose runtime varies in-line with the exponential of one of the inputs (in this case, the number of allowed moves). This means that for large inputs, your algorithm will be unusable and so we should avoid this scenario if possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, unless you are careful with the details of your implementation, it is easy for the required amount of storage to grow with input size, another trait which is undesirable in algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some approaches that avoid these issues. One of which is a dynamic programming approach, shown [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-dialer/solution/). This runs in linear-time and uses constant memory, making it a strong solution. My only issue with this method is that its validity didn't immediately jump out to me. The internal logic is obscured by a series of nested loops and confusing temporary variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "These inefficient or confusing solutions are what made the interview question so interesting to me. Especially because, due to my mathematical background, I almost instantly saw how it could be solved using a solution that is both linear and constant in memory, as with the DP approach. What allowed me to quickly leap to this efficient solution was my knowledge of elementary linear algebra and combinatorics. In fact, this problem translates perfectly into these two fields, leading to a very refined and simplistic solution."

    "My initial insight towards the problem was that the movements of the knight can be abstracted away to the connections between the nodes of a network graph. Abstraction is a very common technique in mathematical problem-solving, in which you remove anything but the bare mathematical structures. The keys can be replaced by labelled nodes and the possible moves of the knight can be replaced by arcs. For example, since the knight can move from the 1 key to the the 6 key, we would have an arc between nodes 1 and 6. We would not have an arc between 1 and 2 however, since this is not a valid move for the knight. This gives us the following graph."

    "This graph completely captures all of the information about the problem. The only issue is, this picture is not currently in a computer readable form. There are many ways of storing graphs but the most common way in mathematics is to use an adjacency matrix. This is an $n\\times n$ matrix (where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph) where the cell in the $i$th row and $j$th column is 1 if nodes $i$ and $j$ are connected by an arc and 0 otherwise. Mathematicians favour this representation since it allows us to use all of the techniques we have developed in linear algebra – as we will see later in this post. The adjacency matrix for the above graph (which we will call $A$) will look like this."

    "Now that we have our graph in a form both friendly for computers and mathematicians alike, we can use a clever theorem from combinatorics to extract some useful information from our matrix. In particular, we use the result that the element in the $i$th row and $j$th column of the matrix $A^k$, for some natural number $k$, gives us the number of distinct paths from node $i$ to node $j$ of length $k$. \n",

    "That's a really interesting result, but what's its relevance to us? It may not seem clear at first, but in fact, knowing this gives the whole game away, providing us with an instant route to the problem's solution. This is because every possible sequence of dialled numbers corresponds exactly with one path through the network. And so, if we know how many paths there are from any starting point to any end point – which we obtain from our exponentiated adjacency matrix – we can simply sum up the values of interest to get our result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, since we want to know the number of paths from a given starting point, we will want to sum over all of the columns of $A^k$ for a fixed row. If we recall how we compute matrix multiplications, it is not too hard to see that in order to get the sum across the $i$th row, we simply multiply $A^k$ by a column vector of length 10 containing only the value 1 and then extract the $i$th component of the resulting column vector. If you are sceptical of this, give it a go with a small arbitrary matrix to convince yourself. \n",

This solution is not perfect however. This approach is limited by the slow computation of $A^k$. Multiplying $10\\times 10$ matrices is not a quick process and doing it $k-1$ times for large $k$ could take a long time. \n",

Exponentiating a diagonal matrix – unlike a general matrix – is incredibly simple. All you have to do is exponent the individual elements, and since the majority of these are zero, this is very easy to do. After computing $D^k$ all that is left to do is compute $A^k=P^TD^kP$ – a computationally easy task – and carry on as described in the last section.\n",

In practice, calculating eigenvalues/vectors of an $n\\times n$ matrix requires $O(n^3)$ time. There are algorithms such as Coppersmith and Winograd which compute these in $O(n^\\omega)$ with $2< \\omega < 3$, but due to the complexity of implementing code for these for little computational gain in most circumstances, they are rarely used. Since our matrix is of fixed size however, this part of the code is simply $O(1)$ time. The only other part of the code worth considering is the computation of $D^k$. This will involve exponentiating 10 numbers $k$ times each and so will run in $O(k)$ time. Hence our algorithm is linear, exactly the same as the dynamic programming approach but, I would argue, far more beautiful. "
