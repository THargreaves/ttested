    "These images by themselves have little use but over the next few years several contributors had grouped together, using these wallpapers, to produce a live wallpaper for android, an integration with Windows and OSX, and a web implementation. Yet the Linux community were not getting much love from the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few scripts kicking around on Github allowing users to manually set up a live version of the wallpaper but these all seem to use fixed time intervals to determine when to change the wallpaper and so in the summer and winter when the time the sun is up is far from the average value, the wallpaper is completely asynchronous to real life. What I wished to do was to set up an implementation for Linux which would use local sunrise and sunset times to adjust when the wallpaper changes to result in an experience that perfectly matches up with the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used data from the [UK Hydrographic Office](http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/surfbin/first_beta.cgi), a website offering free astronomical data for anybody to use. Using this site you can generate a text file containing the sunrise and sunset times for any location in the United Kingdom (with daylight savings already accounted for). I retrieved this data for the entirety of 2018. If you wanted complete accuracy this would need to be updated each year but with the annual difference of the sunrise/set times being in the handfuls of minutes, I don't think this is necessary.\n",
