For simple accounting, visualisation, and data entry I think that Excel is the perfect tool. As the scale and complexity of applications begin to grow, however, it starts to feel that the comfort people find in Excel ends up being more of a burden than a blessing."

On top of this, the lack of portablity between Excel versions, the difficulty of maintaining and documenting such applications, and the inivitable performance limits that a user runs into, have repeatedly made themselves clear. All of this hassle makes me wonder whether it would just be easier for the developers of these products to learn a new, more suitable toolset. It may take a while to learn, say Python, to a competent level, but after seeing the frustration Excel can cause, maybe this is a worthy investment for the long-run."

It concerns a chessboard of dimensions $m\\times n$ where $m,n$ are arbritary positive integers.

This is followed by a valid solution (all queens coexist) that is not optimal (at least one queen of each colour can be added whilst maintaining peace). The final board shows one of many optimal solutions featuring two queens of each colour. You can try as hard as you'd like to find an arrangement with three queens of each colour, but trust me, you'll be searching for a while!"

Ainley found layouts for square chessboards up to size $30\\times30$, only one of which ($27\\times27$) has since been improved upon. There is reason to believe that many of these solutions are indeed optimal, yet we have only proved this for results up to $15\\times15$.

We will have $2mn$ binary constraints plus one more to enforce an equal number of black and white queens. Then we are left with constraints for peacability, of which there will be $|M|$. For each $(i_1, j_1)\\in[m]\\times[n]$ there are $(m-1) + (n-1) + 2(\\text{min}(m, n) - 1)$ squares $(i_2, j_2)\\in[m]\\times[n]$ that share a line with $(i_1, j_1)$ (you can just count them; don't overthink it) and so |M| = $mn(m-1 + n-1 + 2(\\text{min}(m, n) - 1))$.

As suggested above, Excel has a built-in add-on for solving many types of optimisation problems such as integer programming problems. Since we can formulate the peaceable queens problem in this way, we're in a good position to solve it. The only issue is that Excel requires a lot of structural and formula overhead to start the solver (i.e. we must populate the worksheet with a lot of relevant information). In my first draft I did this by hand for the $3\\times3$ case, but this takes a long time so is not suitable for a general solution. Instead we can leverage VBA, a scripting language for controlling Excel, to automatically generate such content."

Unfortunately, this software is equipped hefty price tag of a few thousand dollars. Luckily for us, there is a free 15-day trial. I signed up for this (no card required), installed the software, and let it loose on some larger problems. This raised the size of the largest possible board to around $10\\times10$. This is still not limited by the implemented approach but rather that the trial version has its own (though admittedly, large) variable and constraint limits too. My back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the full version of this solver (with no limits and access to solving algorithms optimised for sparse systems) could result in solutions for boards up to $12\\times12$ and perhaps $13\\times13$ with some patience.
