    "## The Importance of the Fourth Dimension in Data Visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth dimension is often overlooked in data visualisation applications. There are some very understandable reasons for this. To begin, such plots are of no use in static mediums such as scientific journals, research papers or printed blog posts. Furthermore, they often require more effort to produce than single frame plots, perhaps requiring additional tools and packages or, in the worst, the manual stitching together of individual plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its drawbacks, the use of time in the production of data visualisations can be very effective in expressing the meaning of a dataset in a natural and distinctly human way. Consider this example: if I were to give you pictures taken from a fixed camera at secondly intervals of a car driving down a road, you would most likely struggle to build a mental image of how far that car was travelling. This is strange because you have all the necessary data. All you are left to do is interpolate for the moments that you missed and then use your understanding of the world to have a guess at the speed of the car. This would be a surprisingly difficult task, yet if I gave you a video of the moving car, although you may not be completely accurate, you'd be able to make a much better judgement of the speed the car was travelling at."
