    "date: '2019-08-20'\n",
    "excerpt: \"When creating a data science blog, there are many different approaches that can be taken. The main two decisions revolve around how you wish to write your content and which static site generator you wish to use to build your site. For the last year I have been using RStudio, Blogdown, and Hugo to achieve this but - after much deliberation - I have decided that change is needed. This blog post follows my transition to building a data science blog powered by Jupyter and Hexo, the obstacles I came up against, and the solutions I came to employ.\"\n",

    "We all know the saying, \"New Year, New (The)me\". Inspired by that thought - or perhaps just by the idea of using that as an opener - I decided that I would begin the 2019/20 academic year by re-theming this blog. This was meant to be a short and sweet project; move some files, install some packages, and off we go. That couldn't have been further from the truth. In transitioning, I have come across many challenges regarding the immaturity of the integration between static site generators and Jupyter. I have spent considerable time over the summer remedying such issues, and I hope that by documenting my struggles and eventual solutions in this post, I can make a similar move much simpler for anyone doing so in the future."

    "\n",
    "When I first created this blog almost a year ago, I decided to use Hugo as the static site generator behind the site. Reaching this decision was simple. At that time, I was only using R for any data science work and RStudio offered an easy-to-use set of add-ins built upon the `blogdown` package. This made the production of a data science blog a piece of cake. You could build your site directly in RStudio using interactive R notebooks. These would then be processed automatically by the package and converted into a form ready for Hugo to work with. "

    "I am a strong believer in using the right tool for the right job. And through this philosophy, I soon realised that solely using R wasn't going to cut it for complicated projects. I wanted to be learning about and discussing the use of other languages for data science. Currently this has only amounted to a splattering of posts using Python and Bash, but I have plans to be including many more languages in my projects in the future. I therefore want to make sure that I am using a system that is language agnostic and easily expandable.\n",

    "RStudio and Blogdown is not such a system. Although it is technically possible to use Python, SQL, and Bash code in R notebooks, the experience is buggy and generally unpleasant. There is a clear preference towards blogging in R. Although this is the main language I use at the moment, who knows what the data science landscape will look like in five years? And so, I decided that it was time to move away from such a tight-knit ecosystem.\n",

This still wasn't exactly what I wanted - Pelican themes are painfully minimal in both features and design - but it started the ball rolling. I then came across [this](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus) GitHub repository for a Hexo theme called Icarus. Now that was exactly what I wanted. The theme is gorgeous, the documentation for Hexo looked clear and intuitive, and using the ideas from the DataQuest blog post, I cloud easily integrate it with Jupyter notebooks (or so I thought)."

The root of this issue is that the notebook converter places all outputted figures into a folder called `{name-of-post}_files` and then points all image links in the markdown file to that folder. This needs to be changed to the actual directory that you will be storing such images. Since this change is the same every time, you don't even require any regex; a simple call to the `.replace()` string method will do the trick although I did end up going for regex for simplicity."

For a start, the `align*` environment (align environment without line numbering) does not work with Hexo.

Instead you can use the standard `align` environment which for some reason doesn't have line numbers when used with Hexo.\n",

This may be just for cathartic purposes or perhaps someone may be able to suggest a workaround that I have not yet considered. If I do find a solution to any of these issues in the future then I will certainly update this next section."

    "R notebooks offer a great feature where you can run code whilst in a markdown block using the notation `` `r print(\"Hello World\")` ``. In these inline blocks you can also reference variables from the main code chunks. This is incredibly useful when your code has an element of randomness to it and you wish to quote the results that a main code block gave in some explanatory text below. I do not believe there is a simple way to do this and so I have instead resorted to setting random seeds. This works for some cases but not for those such as benchmarking."

    "Another nifty feature of R notebooks is the ability to cache chunk outputs. This means that if you have a long-running piece of code, you can run it once and then store the output for future use. This is more an issue of convenience then actual practicality and so it's not a priority for me to solve right now."

Therefore GIFs have to be generated separately to the main post and embed using Markdown code. Again, this works fine, although seamless integration would be nice."
