As an intermediate step, this involved calculating efficient frontiers, and I was surprised to see the approach that he was taking.

Under the right assumptions (the same as we will introduce later), the problem we are looking at is convex, and so we are guaranteed to find a local optimum, with convergence that is quadratically fast. This is still slower than the method we'll look at below so we won't discuss it further, but it is worth noting that it is also much more efficient than the random approach above.\n",

    "As mentioned above, I was immediately suspicious that an analytic solution existed to the efficient frontier problem. It turned out that this was the case provided we introduced one key assumption: shorting is valid. I will not get into the financial definiton of short-selling now (though you can read about [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)). All we need to care about is that it corresponds to use removing the bounds on our portfolio weights $x_i$. We still however enforce that $\\sum x_i = 1$. Under this condition, our problem becauses a quadratic programming problem which can be solved using Lagrangian multipliers. Note, it is algebraically more elegant to solve the dual form of our problem (minimise risk for a given return), though the same solution is arrived at."
